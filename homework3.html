        <p> Hello, my name is Evynn Olson and I am a student at the University of Denver. In my class, we are studying digital accessibility and the methods used to create and manage web content that is more accessible. By finding more ways to enhance digital accessibilty, we are supportive to individuals who use assistive devices and may face other limitations to direct use with web applications. </p>
        <p> The purpose of this report is to identify potential accessibilty issues within the website, and to offer suggestions for avoiding access issues through restructuring or correcting elements. The checklist being referenced is from <a href="url"> Evaluating Web Accessibility Overview | Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) | W3C</a> I hope you find this report helpful and can move forward with the recommendations to enhance digital accessibilty for support of all web users.

        <h1> Accessibility Checklist </h1>
        <h2> <mark>Website Page Titles</mark> </h2>
        <p> Page titles are the name of the page displayed in the browser bar. It is created with a basic navigable code that allows users to know where they are, keep track of information within specific pages, and often differentiates from other uses of title elements. </p>
        <h3>Results</h3>
            <p> Across ten pages, there were few errors with page titling, codewise and in appearance in the browser tab. There are also metadata tags which add an extra description of the content to be found within each page based on its <b> < title >. </b></p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2><mark>Image Alternative Text</mark></h2>
        <p> Alternative Text is used as a descriptor under images and other like items. The feature of alternative text allows users to understand the context of a certain element that they may not otherwise see without it. For screen readers specifically, this feature allows them to represent an image in a way for the user to understand. It is also a matter of describing the functions of links within a page when there is slow internet connection or an error in the src attribute.</p>
        <h3> Results</h3>
            <p> There are many images and icons across the website that do not have alternative text attributes to the code. This also causes the links of the images to be empty, another issue with trying to find accessible information on the image or other link. One page with many hits for empty, or broken links and no alt text applications is <a href="url">Publications (coloradokids.org)</a>. For the amount of logos and images across the page, there are few supportive text descriptions.</p> 
            <p> To add in alternative text elements, the code may look like this: <b> < img src="____" alt="____"> </b>. This is the simplest snippet for adding alternative text and it can be applied to  many different image elements (.gif, .jpg, .svg, etc.). </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2><mark>Text</mark></h2>
            <p></p>
            <ul>
        <h3>
            <li>Headings</li>
        </h3> 
            <p>The use of headings across a website allows for all content to be organized within specific areas and topics, separated with the use of other headings. Headings are labeled in order of importance: <b>< h1; h2; h3; > </b> which designates the following information into sets and subsets based on importance. Having headings is an important part of accessibility because it provides structure, and easier navigation when using assistive technologies.</p>
            <h4>Results</h4>
                <p>After reading through the use of code across 10 pages, all headings were correctly marked and headings were ordered correctly based on the information organization. It is clear to see where content belongs and separate various sections.</p>
        <h3>
            <li>Contrast Ratio</li>
        </h3>
            <p> Contrast Ratio refers to the color schemes used to provide a clearly difference between text and background colors.
             Having high contrast between colors and sizes used for text, and the background colors provides a more accessible setup for users, especially those who have low vision. Without high contrast, users may struggle to identify text across the webpage or find other navigable features.</p>
            <h4>Results</h4>
            <p> Across the website, color contrasts received a low score for accessibilty. The background colors and text are listed as incompatible because of very low color contrast and this affects multiple pages. The code areas all denote that the contrast setting is on "auto" which does not give a clear indication what ratio is used. The WAI system, however, states that there is less than a 4.5:1 ratio range which is necessary for all text lower than 14 point bold.Listed ratios found across the site include <b>1:1, 2.82:1, 3.94:1, and 4.19:1.</b>
             Adjustments for the contrast section of the accessibility checker allows a visual for how changes will appear if utilized in the website code.
                <p> On the Accessibilty Statement found here: <a href="url"> Accessibility Statement - Colorado Children's Campaign (coloradokids.org)</a>, there is acknowledgment of the known contrast issues and other pieces of the website that need to better adhere to W3C and WCAG 2 AA. This is a positive feature to let users know that specific accessibility changes are in progress.</p>
        <h3>
            <li>Resize Text</li>
        </h3>
            <p>Text resizing formats can be supportive to a website if the website has a stable structure across its pages. This means that upon text zooming, there is no issue of congestion or overlap among sections, texts, or images. This is often a browser initiated process,and a separate feature from whole-page zooming which may require an extension to the browser. Having the ability to zoom text size provides users with visual impairments the preferential control to focus on written content only and in a larger size than the standard page.</p>
            <h4> Results </h4>
            <p> Using the Chrome browser to complete this review, I noticed that the only way to get a text-only zoom feature is through adding an extension to the browser. Once I downloaded the extension, I was able to enhance text on the CO Kids website without any overlap across sections. What I did notice was the images would cut off into the end of their section when text was enlarged, but this had no effect on actually reading the text at a larger scale. </p>
